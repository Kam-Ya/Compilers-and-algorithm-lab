# Compilier & Algorithm Design Lab

1. Lab1
    - An intro lab outlining the goals of the lab **Create a simple interpreter**
    - no work to be done in this lab
    - next 3 labs after this will build upon eachother
2. Lab2 **Design and create a Lexical Analyzer**
    - Simply should print what the input is (i.e. input: *;*  output: *semicolon*)
    - Handles:
        1. Operators (including Parenthesis and Colons)
        2. Keywords
        3. Identifiers
        4. Integers
        5. Comments
        6. Quoted Strings
3. Lab3 **Use Yacc to generate a parser and construct an interpreter**
    - Generate output based on the keywords used as input
    - Handle simple logic
    - Evaluate expressions (Both mathematical and true or false)
4. Lab4 **Improve the interpreter**
    - To improve the interpreter I am tasked with adding Variable Assignment
5. Lab5 **Create programs to compare and contrast different sorting algorithms.**
    - Make minor changes to provided code to allow sorting algorithms to sort generic datatypes.
    - Create and implement interfaces to check:
        1. How many compares each algorithm makes
        2. The relative error of each algorithm
        3. The Big O of the algorithm
    - Update provided test driver to ensure correct completion of previous steps.
